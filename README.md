# CatVsDog_Image_Classification_Project

***Overview***

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes. The dataset consists of thousands of labeled images, making it a robust example for image classification tasks.
